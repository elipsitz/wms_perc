# wms_perc
Source code and compilations for Williams Level 7 Pinball Machines. Also includes wdasm executable that with a configuration file (barracora included as example)... will reverse the ROM images into a 'fully compilable' version of the code using the WMS_PERC files and also files potentially contained in my TASMx-Library repo here -> https://github.com/jessaskey/TASMx-Library

NOTES:

1. These files are a bit messy right now, the compilation .bat files may need fixed and unfortunately tasmx.exe is in every game folder for now.
2. Need to move this to work with the TASM-IDE tool here https://github.com/jessaskey/TASM-IDE
3. Mostly wanted to get this stuff posted before I lose it all. :-)
