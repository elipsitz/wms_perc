Lamp Summary for Williams Level 7 
Jess M. Askey 2006
---------------------------------------
Level 7 code supports 64 lamps and each lamp has four 'state' flags. This totals 8 bytes per lamp 
matrix times 4 bits each = 32 bytes of RAM space. The lamp state flags are stored in sequential 
groups of 8 bytes, this allows the different bits for each lamp to be mathematically compared very
easy. The state flags are stored at the following RAM locations

$0010	buffer0
$0018	flashflag
$0020	buffer1
$0028	bufferselect

Buffer 0 - This buffer holds the displayed lamp state when the lampbufferselect bit for the 
			associated lamp is at 0.
			
FlashFlag - This flag determines if the lamp is using the system defined flash rate. Note: When
			this flag is set, there is a system process that scans for set flags and then 
			toggles the actual lamp value in buffer0. Therefore, if you have this flag set
			you cannot rely on knowing the state of the buffer0 value anymore. If you want to
			maintain state info for the lamp, while also using this flash flag, maintain
			your state in buffer1 since that is unchanged by the flash routine.
			
Buffer 1 - This buffer holds the displayed lamp state when the lampbufferselect bit for the
			associated lamp is at 1.
			
BufferSelect - This flag determines which buffer is used by the IRQ routine when setting the state
			of each lamp. 0 selects buffer0 while 1 selects buffer1.

Notes:			
lamp flash only effects lamp if it is on buffer 0
lamp flash bit physically toggles the buffer 0 bit when enabled, when it is disabled, the state of buffer 0 is unknown

Because of the space in which the macros are defined, there are two macro sets that manipulate the lamp ranges.
the *0_ macros effect the first two lamp flags and the *1_ macros effect the last two flags. 

I will combine these two seperate commands into one command in the future. But for now, there are two of them as 
the native macros are defined.

0_ Range Macros Effect
0 lampbuffer0
1 lampflashflag

1_ Range Macros Effect
0 lampbuffer1	
1 lampbufferselect

For each Range Macro Set, bit $40 determines which buffer to act upon for effect.

RSET0_/RSET1_		Set Entire Range in Specified Buffer + Set Select to Buffer 0
RCLR0_/RCLR1_		Clear Entire Range in Specified Buffer + Set Select to Buffer 0
RSET1R0_/RSET1R1_		Goes through range bits from low to high and
				finds first cleared bit, sets it and exits.
RSET1RC0_/RSET1RC1_	Goes through range bits from low to high and
				finds first cleared bit, sets it and exits. If 
				all bits in range are already set, then routine 
				clears all bits in range.
RCLR1L0_/RCLR1L1_		Goes through range bits from high to low, routine
				finds first bit in range that is set and clears
				it and then exits.
RROL0_/RROL1_		Rotate current range bits from high to low
RROR0_/RROR1_		Rotate current range bits from low to high
RINV0_/RINV1_		Inverts state of all bits in range
